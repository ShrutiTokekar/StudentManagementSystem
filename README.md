The Student Management System is a Java application designed to manage student records, course enrollment, and grade tracking efficiently. 

Main.java serves as the entry point for the application, providing a console interface where users can interact with various functionalities such as adding students and enrolling them in courses. 

Student.java defines the student object, containing properties like ID, name, enrolled courses, and grades, along with methods to manage this information. 

Course.java can be used to expand course management features in future updates, although itâ€™s not directly utilized in the current implementation. 

StudentManager.java handles the core logic for managing students, including adding new students, enrolling them in courses, recording grades, and retrieving student information.
